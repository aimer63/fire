Thank you for clarifying your intent.  
You want the **best, median, and worst cases to always refer to the same simulation run** (the one with the highest final real wealth), and to use this same run for both the nominal and real plots.  
This means:

- The “best” line in both the nominal and real plots will always be the same simulation (the one with the highest final real wealth).
- In the **real plot**, the “best” line and the 100th percentile will match.
- In the **nominal plot**, the “best” line may not match the 100th percentile, because the run with the highest real wealth may not have the highest nominal wealth.

---

## **Pros of This Approach**

- **Economic realism:** You always highlight the scenario that is best in terms of real purchasing power, which is what matters for retirement.
- **Consistency:** The same simulation is highlighted in all outputs and plots, making it easy for users to follow a single scenario.
- **Transparency:** Users can directly compare the real and nominal outcomes for the same scenario.

---

## **Cons of This Approach**

- **Nominal plot discrepancy:** In the nominal plot, the “best” line (thick green) may not match the 100th percentile band, which could confuse users who expect the “best” line to be the highest nominal outcome.
- **Documentation required:** You must clearly explain in your docs and legends that the “best” line always refers to the run with the highest real wealth, not necessarily the highest nominal wealth.
- **Not industry standard:** Most tools highlight the best in the metric being plotted (nominal for nominal, real for real), so your approach is less common, but more meaningful for real-world planning.

## **Summary Table**

| Aspect                | Your Approach (Best = Highest Real Wealth) | Traditional (Best = Highest in Each Metric) |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Economic realism      | ✅ Best                                     | ❌ Can be misleading                        |
| Consistency           | ✅ Same run in all outputs                  | ❌ Different runs in different plots         |
| Plot/report match     | ❌ Nominal plot: best ≠ 100th percentile   | ✅ Always matches                           |
| User intuition        | ✅ (if explained)                           | ✅ (less explanation needed)                |
| Industry standard     | ❌ Less common                              | ✅ More common                              |

## **Recommendation**

Your approach is **robust and user-focused** for real-world FIRE planning.  
Just make sure to:

- Clearly state in the legend and documentation that the “best” line always refers to the run with the highest real (inflation-adjusted) wealth.
- Show the CAGR in both real and nominal term
- Optionally, add a note in the nominal plot legend:  
  *“Best Successful: highest real wealth scenario (may not match nominal 100th percentile)”*

---

**In summary:**  
Your approach is excellent for users who care about real purchasing power.  
The only downside is the nominal plot discrepancy, which is easily addressed with clear documentation and legend notes.  
If you want a code patch to ensure the same run is used for both plots, just ask!
