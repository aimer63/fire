# FIRE Simulator Outputs Overview

This document summarizes all user-facing outputs generated by the FIRE simulator.

---

## 1. Console Output

- **Config parameters dump:**  
  - At the start of each run, all loaded configuration parameters are printed to the console for full transparency and reproducibility.
- **Simulation summary:**  
  - Success rate, number of failed simulations, and average months lasted in failed cases.
- **Key scenario details:**  
  - Worst, **median** (formerly "average"), and best successful cases.
  - Final wealth (nominal and real), CAGR, and asset allocations (percentages and nominal values).
- **Warnings and errors:**  
  - Any issues encountered during simulation or analysis.

---

## 2. Markdown Report

- **Comprehensive summary:**  
  - Mirrors the console output, but in Markdown format for easier sharing and archiving.
- **Asset breakdown tables:**  
  - For each key scenario, shows nominal value of each asset and bank, with sum and consistency check.
- **Plots:**  
  - Links to generated plots (relative paths).
- **Loaded parameters:**  
  - JSON block with all simulation parameters/configuration.
- **Metadata:**  
  - Config file used, run date, and simulator version.

## 3. Plots (PNG/Images)

All plots are saved as PNG files in the output directory.  
**Note:** Some plots use a logarithmic (log) scale for better visualization of wide-ranging values.

- **wealth_evolution_nominal.png**  
  - Evolution of total wealth over time (nominal terms, log scale).

- **wealth_evolution_real.png**  
  - Evolution of total wealth over time (real/inflation-adjusted terms, log scale).

- **bank_account_trajectories_nominal.png**  
  - Bank account balances over time (nominal terms).

- **bank_account_trajectories_real.png**  
  - Bank account balances over time (real/inflation-adjusted terms).

- **nominal_final_wealth_distribution.png**  
  - Distribution of final total wealth across all simulations (nominal terms, may use log scale).

- **real_final_wealth_distribution.png**  
  - Distribution of final total wealth across all simulations (real/inflation-adjusted terms, may use log scale).

- **failed_sims_duration_distribution.png**  
  - Distribution of durations (in months/years) for failed simulations.

- **Other visualizations:**  
  - (Optional/future) Asset allocation over time, scenario comparisons, etc.

## 4. Data Files (Optional/Future)

- **Raw results:**  
  - (Planned) Export to CSV/Excel for further analysis.
- **Intermediate data:**  
  - (Planned) Pickle or JSON files for debugging or reproducibility.

---

## 5. Logs

- **Error and debug logs:**  
  - (If enabled) Detailed logs for troubleshooting.
