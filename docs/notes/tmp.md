You are correct. The issue was introduced during the refactoring. Your proposed plan is clear and addresses the root cause by properly separating concerns.

Let's break down the plan for discussion.

**Proposed Plan:**

1. **Refactor `MarketAssumptions` Model:**

   - Remove the `assets: dict[str, Asset]` field from the `MarketAssumptions` model in `firestarter/config/config.py`. It should only be responsible for the `correlation_matrix`.
   - This also means removing the validator from `MarketAssumptions` that was checking for consistency between its (now removed) `assets` field and the `correlation_matrix`.

2. **Refactor `CorrelationMatrix` Model:**

   - In `firestarter/config/correlation_matrix.py`, rename the `assets: list[str]` field to something more descriptive to avoid confusion with the main `assets` dictionary. A name like `asset_order: list[str]` or `matrix_assets: list[str]` would be appropriate. This clarifies that its purpose is to define the order and contents of the matrix rows/columns.

3. **Update `Config` Model Validator:**

   - The `model_validator` in the `Config` model (`validate_cross_config_consistency`) is the correct place for the cross-component validation.
   - It must be updated to compare the keys of the top-level `Config.assets` dictionary with the newly renamed asset list in `Config.market_assumptions.correlation_matrix`.

4. **Update Simulation Logic:**
   - The `SequenceGenerator` in `firestarter/core/sequence_generator.py` currently takes a `MarketAssumptions` object and uses `market_assumptions.assets` and `market_assumptions.lognormal`.
   - The `SequenceGenerator`'s constructor must be changed. Instead of just `market_assumptions`, it should accept both the top-level `assets: dict[str, Asset]` (from `Config.assets`) and the `market_assumptions: MarketAssumptions` object.

This plan correctly decouples `MarketAssumptions` from the asset definitions, clarifies the purpose of the asset list within the correlation matrix, places validation logic in the correct parent container, and provides the simulation engine with the data it needs directly.
