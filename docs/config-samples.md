# Where to Find Example Configuration Files

Example configuration files are not distributed in the Python package.  
To obtain them, download directly from the [configs directory in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/aimer63/fire/tree/master/configs).

Example path:

```
configs/config.toml
```

> **Note:**  
> Always refer to the GitHub repository for the latest configuration samples.
