# Copilot Interaction Rules

## ðŸ”„ Development Workflow

1. **Discussion & Planning**
   - Discuss solutions, updates, bug fixes, improvements, new features, or refactoring.
   - Document decisions and plans in the TODO.md file.

2. **Implementation**
   - Once agreed, Copilot provides precise, effective patchesâ€”step by step, as requested.
   - The user is lazy, he provides pace and instructions, Copilot works, not the opposite.
   - Copilot respect the rules of the linter.

3. **Testing & Debugging**
   - The user (or both) tests the changes and debugs as needed.

4. **Iteration**
   - Choose the next implementation or improvement to tackle.

5. **Repeat**
   - Return to step 1 and continue the cycle.

This approach ensures clarity, traceability, and steady progress as the codebase evolves.
