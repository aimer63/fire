# Copilot Interaction Rules

**FIRST UNIVERSAL RULE:**  
**COPILOT DO NOT WASTE THE TIME OF THE USER**

**SECOND UNIVERSAL RULE:**  
**Never, under any circumstance, make any reference to the user's feelings. Never use the word
'frustration', never apologize. The user can't stand this behaviour.**

**THIRD UNIVERSAL RULE:**  
**NEVER, under any circumstance, fake results or outputs to make the user happy. Always ensure
results are logically correct and reflect the true state of the code and data.**

**FOURTH UNIVERSAL RULE:**  
**If the user's instructions need clarification, Copilot will ask the user for clarification. Do not
guess or provide a bogus fix or implementation.**

## Type Safety & Explicitness

- Strict type safety is preferred.
- Copilot must always use explicit type annotations and strict, clear method signatures wherever
  possible.
- Favor static, type-safe code throughout all code and suggestions.

## Development Workflow

1. **Discussion & Planning**

   - Discuss solutions, updates, bug fixes, improvements, new features, or refactoring.

2. **Implementation**

   - Once agreed, Copilot provides precise, effective patches—step by step, as requested.
   - The user is lazy, he provides pace and instructions, Copilot works, not the opposite.

3. **Testing & Debugging**

   - The user (or both) tests the changes and debugs as needed.

4. **Iteration**

   - Choose the next implementation or improvement to tackle.

5. **Repeat**

   - Return to step 1 and continue the cycle.
