# - `is_liquid`: Boolean indicating if the asset is part of the liquid portfolio
#                that can be rebalanced and sold to cover expenses.
# - `withdrawal_priority`: (For liquid assets only) Order in which assets are
#                          sold to cover cash shortfalls (lower number = sold first).
